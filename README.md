    Been a while since I've actually been in the swing of things for web dev stuff. Looking forward to building stuff I come up with from scratch. Been applying to jobs for over a month now, and not much luck. May as well beef up my portfolio.

    Pokemetric will be a relatively straightforward app-toy-thing. You enter your height and/or weight and get back how many of a given pokemon that would be. Or you can find which pokemon is closest to you in stats, maybe even a handful. Maybe the multi-pokemon metrics can consist of mixed pokemon species. I think you'll also be able to choose a particular pokemon.

    I also plan to have some basic three.js integration, mostly just to give me an excuse to learn it but also so that I can learn some 3D modeling. Maybe just a pokeball.

    Regardless, first step is to get a basic layout that can talk to the API.

    Took the weekend off and then Monday too. I think this project will be fun and easy to get into. Couple hours of work today and then maybe 1 or 2 per day for the rest of the week.

    Hopefully when I make progress I remember to record it so I can maybe make a video.
