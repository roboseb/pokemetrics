An app that lets you compare your height and weight to those of pokemon.

    Been a while since I've actually been in the swing of things for web dev stuff. Looking forward to building stuff I come up with from scratch. Been applying to jobs for over a month now, and not much luck. May as well beef up my portfolio.

    Pokemetric will be a relatively straightforward app-toy-thing. You enter your height and/or weight and get back how many of a given pokemon that would be. Or you can find which pokemon is closest to you in stats, maybe even a handful. Maybe the multi-pokemon metrics can consist of mixed pokemon species. I think you'll also be able to choose a particular pokemon.

    I also plan to have some basic three.js integration, mostly just to give me an excuse to learn it but also so that I can learn some 3D modeling. Maybe just a pokeball.

    Regardless, first step is to get a basic layout that can talk to the API.

    Took the weekend off and then Monday too. I think this project will be fun and easy to get into. Couple hours of work today and then maybe 1 or 2 per day for the rest of the week.

    Hopefully when I make progress I remember to record it so I can maybe make a video.

    Hoping to crank out some more progress today as I'd like to have this done around the end of next week. With the basic inputs I have set up I can hopefully have the app tell you how many of x pokemon you are tall/heavy fairly quickly.

    We now have a system that will give you a pokemon at random if the API cannot find the one you typed out. It also gives a conversion telling you how many of a given pokemon you are tall, when it works.

--To-Do--

-basic inputs
DONE-Enter pokemon name
DONE-enter weight
DONE-enter height
-average both
-show pokemon stats
-custom font
-three.js integration
-prevent errors for unexpected input
-verify fetches are sanitized with input
-implement constraints for height/weight/pokemon name length
-unit options (default metric?)
person silhouette to compare sizes, keep pokemon same size never change man. Never cut pokemon art off.
-error message for pokemon not found
